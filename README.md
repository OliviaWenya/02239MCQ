# 02239 - Data Security Exam Questions

This repository contains previous exam questions for the "02239 - Data Security" course at DTU, ranging from 2018 to 2023. Due to the high demand for these resources, they have been compiled and made available here for convenience.

## What’s Included
- **Previous Exam Questions (2018–2023):** A collection of questions to help you prepare for the exam.
- **Quick Guide for OFMC:** Since there is almost always an OFMC-related question, a quick guide has been added to jog your memory when needed (even if you took Logic for Security—great course, by the way!).
- **MCQ Design Guidelines:** These guidelines, which I shared with someone who found them incredibly useful, are now included to help you understand the structure and focus of the multiple-choice questions.
- **Diffie-Hellman (DH):** DH in Anna and Bob notation, as they are a recurring topic in the exams.

## Notes
- **Course Updates:** Keep in mind that significant changes to the course may occur, especially since Christian is no longer a professor at DTU.
