02239 - Data Security
Previous exam questions publicly shared due to an overwhelming amounts of requests, currently ranging from 2018 to 2023.

Quick guide for OFMC added because there will be a question about it, and I will have forgotten how to OFMC... Even though I did Logic for Security... (Nice course btw :D)

I showed "the design guidelines" for the MCQ to someone and they were mindblown, so it's been included.

And there's always a DH question so why not also have it? 

Keep in mind significant changes will most likely happen in the course going forward, given Christian is no longer a professor at DTU.
